Subject: [Action Required] Raw Data Export X Changes

As part of scheduled work to improve the performance and reliability of
our Data Export feature for Optimizely X, we are making changes to the
way you access your Optimizely X raw data files.

*Action Required*
Please modify your raw data import process to use the new AWS bucket
name, folder path and file naming structure by following the
instructions below.  Note that we will stop generating raw data in the
current AWS bucket after July 14th, 2017.

Migration Step

- Update your raw data import process to use the AWS bucket name
  optimizely-export-ng/
- Update the read folder to
  account_id/project_id/2.0/yyyy/mm/dd/experiment_id/
  (e.g, 123456789/234567890/2.0/2017/04/06/987654321/)
- In the new AWS bucket, the raw data is now stored in multiple file
  parts as opposed to a single file, which is the case in the current
  bucket. The file parts use the following naming structure:
  experiment_id-filepartnum-yyyy-mm-dd-r-reducernum.gz
  (e.g. 987654321-0-2017-03-06-r-00062.gz). Update your process to
  extract and read the file parts. Please note the following
  conventions:
      - The unzipped files do not have any file extension, but use the
        same tsv format.
      - There are up to 30 file parts per experiment per day
        (filepartnum = 0-29).
